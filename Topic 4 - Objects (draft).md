JavaScript Objects Overview  

 

1. Introduction to JavaScript Objects  

    What is an Object? 

    An object in JavaScript is a collection of key-value pairs that can store data and functions, used to model real-world data and organize related information. 
     { name: 'Alice', age: 25 } 

 
 

    Importance of Objects 
     JavaScript objects are essential because they allow developers to organize and structure data logically, mirroring real-world entities. Objects store related information in key-value pairs, making it easy to access, manipulate, and manage complex data sets. 
      
    Objects facilitate interaction with APIs and the Document Object Model (DOM), which are central to dynamic web applications. 

JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data format inspired by JavaScript objects, commonly used to transfer data between servers and web applications. JSON represents data in key-value pairs, making it easy to read and write. 

2. Creating and Accessing Objects  

    Object Creation 

    Object literal syntax: const person = { name: 'Alice', age: 25 }; 

    Object constructor syntax: const obj = new Object(); 

    Accessing Object Properties 

    Dot notation: person.name 

    Bracket notation: person['name'] 

    Dynamic property access 

  

    Code Examples 

const car = { 

    make: 'Toyota', 

    model: 'Camry', 

    year: 2020, 

    owner: { name: 'Alex', age: 30 } 

}; 

  

console.log(car.make);       // Dot notation 

console.log(car['model']);   // Bracket notation 

  

3. Adding, Updating, and Deleting Properties  

    Adding and Updating Properties 

    Using dot and bracket notation as seen in previous examples 

    Deleting Properties 

    delete keyword 

car.color = 'blue';          // Adding a new property 

car.owner.age = 31;          // Updating a nested property 

delete car.year;             // Deleting a property 

  

  

  

  

    Nested objects 
      
    const student = { 
       name: "John Doe", 
       age: 21, 
       contact: { 
         email: "johndoe@example.com", 
         phone: { 
           home: "123-456-7890", 
           mobile: "098-765-4321" 
         } 
       }, 

  courses: { 
     math: { 
       score: 95, 
       teacher: "Ms. Smith" 
     }, 
     science: { 
       score: 89, 
       teacher: "Mr. Johnson" 
     } 

  } 

}; 

  

// Accessing a nested property 

console.log(student.contact.phone.mobile); // "098-765-4321" 

console.log(student.courses.math.teacher); // "Ms. Smith" 

  

4. Object Methods  

    Defining Methods 

    Adding functions within an object 

    The this Keyword 

    Refers to the object in which the method is defined 

    Example 

const person = { 

    name: 'Alice', 

    age: 25, 

    greet: function() { 

        console.log(`Hello, my name is ${this.name}`); 

    } 

}; 

person.greet();  // "Hello, my name is Alice" 

  

  

In JavaScript, the this keyword refers to the current object context, often within an object method. Hereâ€™s a simple example: 

  

const person = {  

name: "Alice",  

age: 30,  

greet() {  

console.log(`Hello, my name is ${this.name} and I am ${this.age} years old.`);  

} 

};  

  

person.greet(); // Output: "Hello, my name is Alice and I am 30 years old." 

5. Common Object Operations  

    Looping through Objects 

    for...in loop 

const car = {  
make: "Toyota", 
  model: "Camry",  
year: 2021  
};  
 
for (let key in car) {  
console.log(`${key}: ${car[key]}`);  
} 

    Object.keys(),  

In a JavaScript object items are grouped in key-value pairs with the key being the identifier and the value being the value of the data. 

  

const book = {  
title: "1984",  
author: "George Orwell",  
published: 1949  
};  

const keys = Object.keys(book);  
console.log(keys); // Output: ["title", "author", "published"]  

// Iterating through keys to log each key-value pair  
keys.forEach(key => {  
console.log(`${key}: ${book[key]}`);  
}); 

    Object.values() 

Object.values works similarly as above. 
 Object.values extracts all the values from the object and returns them in an array. 

const car = {  
make: "Toyota",  
model: "Camry",  
year: 2021 };  

const values = Object.values(car);  
console.log(values);  // ["Toyota", "Camry", 2021] 

    Object.entries() 

    Merging and Cloning Objects 

    Object.assign() 

    Spread syntax { ...object } 

    Code Examples 

const personDetails = { ...person, location: 'NYC' }; 

console.log(Object.keys(person));   // ['name', 'age', 'greet'] 

 

Practical Exercises  

    Basic Object Creation and Manipulation 

    Create an object book with properties title, author, and year. 

    Add a new property genre and update the year. 

    Delete the genre property. 

    Object Methods and this Keyword 

    Create a user object with properties username, email, and a method login that prints "username has logged in". 

    Test the method by calling it from the user object. 

    Looping through Object Properties 

    Create an object movie with properties like title, director, releaseYear, and rating. 

    Use for...in to log each key and value. 

    Print all values using Object.values(). 

    Destructuring and Merging 

    Given two objects, address and contact, merge them into a new object profile. 

    Use destructuring to extract street from address and email from contact.
